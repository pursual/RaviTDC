# Turner Developer Challenge
Thanks for considering me (Tony Gutierrez) for a job at Turner Broadcasting.


## Setup

You should be able to npm install with the included /tweets/package.json. Then run "node app.js" in the "tweets" folder. The app runs on port 3000.

## Features

* Put any twitter handle in the url (i.e http://localhost:3000/cnn)
* Using DustJS compiled template and a custom date helper on the client side
* Urls are clickable.
* Tweets are clickable.
* rudimentary image displaying.


## ToDos
In a production environment I would need error handling for the ajax request. Also all node routes need error handling.

The node api could return less data per tweet as I am not using all fields in the UI.

Images kind of screw up the two column layout, could use further styling treatment.
